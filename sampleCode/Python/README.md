# IMPLAN Impact API - Python Workflow Examples

## Introduction
This is a collection of example workflow scripts written for modern Python - `3.13.5`.  

## ‚ö° Installation and Execution

- Two environment variables must be specified for authentication:
  - `IMPLAN_USERNAME` = Your IMPLAN username
  - `IMPLAN_PASSWORD` = Your IMPLAN password
- You may also create an `.env` file in the same directory as `main.py` that specifies them:
```env
IMPLAN_USERNAME="{YOUR USER NAME HERE}"
IMPLAN_PASSWORD="{YOUR PASSWORD HERE"
```
- You may need to install several Python packages in order to run these scripts.
  - [Installing Packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/)
- Execution starts in `main.py`; examine that file for more details on what examples are available.
- It is fully intended for the code in this project to be copied + pasted, modified, and reused for your purposes; this code is release under [The MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit). 


## üìÇ Folders
- The `endpoints` folder contains a collection of classes that implement `ApiEndpoint`, all of these group together related Impact API endpoints into simple methods.
