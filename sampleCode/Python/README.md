## ‚ö° Installation and Execution

- Two environment variables must be specified for authentication:
  - `IMPLAN_USERNAME` = Your IMPLAN username
  - `IMPLAN_PASSWORD` = Your IMPLAN password
- You may also create an `.env` file in the same directory as `main.py` that specifies them:
```env
IMPLAN_USERNAME="{YOUR USER NAME HERE}"
IMPLAN_PASSWORD="{YOUR PASSWORD HERE"
```
- You may need to install several Python packages in order to run these scripts
  - *todo: instructions*
- Is it intended that execution start with `main.py`, examine that file for more details on what examples are available
