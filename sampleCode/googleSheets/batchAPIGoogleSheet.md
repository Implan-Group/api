# Batch API Google Sheet

You can access the Batch API sample Google Sheet at: [IMPLAN Batch API Demo](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uf8s3pcfAKBPJauhIkF-_EhLFgNHDcFR1cN3BHdVI3g/edit?usp=sharing). 

You will need to duplicate the spreadsheet to add your API username/password, run the samples, and modify the code. 

Once you duplicate the spreadsheet (File | Make a Copy), you will need to add your username and password in the Auth sheet. 

To explore the source code, go to Extensions | App Script. 

Please note, the source code was written to be illustrative and easy to read - it is not optimized for performance. If you are reading or writing a large amount of data from the spreadsheet, Google recommends you read/write ranges for efficiency. 

If you have any questions, would like a personalized demo, or would like to add the API to your subscription, please email support@implan.com
